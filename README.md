## 3 IDIOTS
3 Idiots (stylized as 3 idiots) is a 2009 Indian Hindi-language coming-of-age comedy-drama film written and directed by Rajkumar Hirani, co-written by Abhijat Joshi and produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra. Adapted loosely from Chetan Bhagat's novel Five Point Someone,[5] the film stars Aamir Khan, R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi in the titular roles, marking their reunion 3 years after Rang De Basanti (2006), while Kareena Kapoor, Boman Irani and Omi Vaidya star in pivotal roles. Narrated through parallel dramas, one in the present and the other ten years in the past, the story follows the friendship of three students at an Indian engineering college and is a satire about the social pressures under an Indian education system.
